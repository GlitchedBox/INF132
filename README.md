Download the zip folder and double click on the loginScreen.html and that's it!
By default, if you do not put in a password, you go to the doctor's version of the program.

Based on which user you want to test go to the functions.js file and on the current_user_info variable, in the role section, you will replace trainer with doctor, and vice versa if doctor is there already.

Also when you want to test the trainer, you have to also remove the "admin" role, if it is on there.

To test the doctor
id: 1234567
password: password1

To test the trainer
id: 0987654
password: password2

To test the admin
id: 7654321
password: password3
